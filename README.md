**Face Profiling using Computer Vision (YOLOv8)**
**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates Face Profiling using Computer Vision techniques and the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model.
The system can detect, recognize, and profile human faces from images and video streams in real-time with high accuracy.

**It can be used in multiple domains like:**

Security & Surveillance

Attendance & Monitoring Systems

Healthcare

Behavioral Analysis

**Features**

Real-time face detection using YOLOv8.

High accuracy and fast inference speed.

Works on both images and video streams.

Easy to integrate with other applications.

**Tech Stack**

Python

OpenCV – for image processing and visualization

YOLOv8 – for face detection & profiling
